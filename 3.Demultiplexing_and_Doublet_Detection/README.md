## Demultiplexing, doublet detection, and QC

This repository contains a pipeline for demultiplexing and doublet detection from PSC scRNA-seq data.

## Souporcell Analysis Pipeline 

Clustering mixed-genotype scRNAseq experiments by individual using [souporcell](https://github.com/wheaton5/souporcell)

### Prerequisites
**Environment**: The pipeline is designed to run on a Slurm cluster.

**Reference Data**: The pipeline uses the GRCh38 human genome reference.
